# ptb
Social XR creation tool built on Godot 4

# I am looking for funding for this project:

If you are a grant provider or an investor and are interested
in a project that's primary focus is to create an ecosystem
that allows people to experience, learn, and create XR
content and experiences with various systems; targeted 
at all age groups and team sizes, then this is for you.

The eventual goal is to produce a highly performant XR
creation toolkit with tons of built in features that will
allow people (researchers, developers, students, etc.) to 
very easily create whatever kind of XR experience they want.
Once the project is to a point where the primary features are
avaliable, the team will shift focus to helping Godot 4+ 
keep up to date with XR hardware into the future, so that
the PTB platform can offer a powerful and easy to learn
creation toolkit for the widest range of XR related hardware as
possible.

This is not a "metaverse" project. It is a social/collaborative
creation toolkit. It will allow users to create content in VR/AR
or on desktop with dedicated tooling. The idea is to create a
platform that will help push more XR creation and help the 
general public create XR content and socialize safely within
VR/AR. 

Another major planned feature, is a defined and documented format
for XR objects. We also have a small group who are working together
to define and agree upon a format that will be propogated across
the existing and future XR creation projects. This is called:
XR:OG - XR Object Group

## Status

This project is currently at the beginning of it's development.

If you want to see a deprecated version of the starting concepts of this project,
you can check out Lucid and the GB prefixed projects. 

I was initially planning on building this system for the web using A-Frame, but it
proved to not be quite up to par. There is a consideration on our part to refactor
A-Frame to use newer/faster rendering APIs.
