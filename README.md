BarkVR is an open-source and decentralized social XR creativity tool, built upon the solid foundation of Godot 4.x.

# WARNING:

Please keep in mind that this software is not secure in it's current state. It is a completely open tool that exposes
godot functionality to you and any other user you connect to. This will likely remain true until the first alpha. The
first alpha will contain basic security and network sync exclusions to allow you to prevent users from pushing code
to your device unless you clearly and explicitly allow it. But those features are not ready yet.

## Status:
The project is still in the very early stages. Please feel free to support the project however you wish, or not at all.

## Core Focus:
- Accessibility: Making BarkVR welcoming to everyone, regardless of background or ability.
- Decentralized Design: Giving users the power to shape BarkVR's world through decentralization.
- User Empowerment: Providing users with complete control over their creations for a sense of ownership.
- Open Design: Welcoming collaboration and transparency to evolve BarkVR together.
- VR FOSS: Leading the charge in open-source VR for limitless innovation.
- Social VR: Creating a space where connections thrive beyond physical limits, fostering shared experiences and boundless imagination.

We're working to incorporate technologies like the Matrix messaging API for user managment and ppfs for our storage solution.
This means the whole platform is completely open and capable of being run/hosted without any reliance on the maintainers.

For those eager to follow BarkVR's progress, the "dev" branch is where the latest changes are. Main will eventually be reserved for tagged releases.
