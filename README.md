# barkvr
Social XR creation tool built on Godot 4

Though the project is not yet ready for a release of any kind,
if you would like to test it out and wonder how to launch in
desktop or XR modes, you can use the terminal and start the
app with the flag `--xr-mode` set to `default`, `on`, or `off` like
this: `./barkvr --xr-mode off` will launch without VR active,
while in the editor, you can use the project settings xr settings to
enable vr mode.
